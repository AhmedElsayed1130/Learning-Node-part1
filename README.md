# Learning-Node-part1
things i have learnt while taking the Nodejs-complete guide course


mostley the html pages i didnt make them myself i was just practicing my node course
the project starts with server.js where i make an http server 
the routes.js is where i handle the requests notice that i have exported the requestHandler from routes.js to the server
for simplicity 

the main thing i've learnt is 
1-how to create an http server using the http module 
2-how to parse the body of a request and how to write to the request body and the response body
3-how to parse things written on my device using fs module 
4.how to apply promises to handle the async functions
